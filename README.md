# Mod_3_Project

--Model Goal:
  --Medicaid reviews the average price of certain drug ingredients in the US to determine if they breach the federal upper limit (FUL)
  --We want to build a model that will predict whether a given ingredient (or combination of ingredients) will breach the FUL based on:
    --Ingredient Name
    --Associated ingredient(s)
    --Strength of an ingredient(s) (or dosage)
    --Form of medication (i.e. tablet, etc.)
    --Route (i.e. Oral, etc.)
    --package size
  --Our target for this data set will be whether or not the Medicaid has determined that an ingredient is in violation of the 175% average manufacturer price

--Stretch Goal:
  --Look at the model's predictions to identify which ingredients are most likely to be above FUL and determine what they are used for
